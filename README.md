# Pairs_Trading


A simple implementation of a Pairs Trading model. 
The project consists of finding a suitable pair (via correlation, stationarity check, etc.), implementing the strategy, and backtesting. 
The result obtained is a Sharpe Ratio of 0.88, which, given the simplicity of the strategy, is acceptable.
